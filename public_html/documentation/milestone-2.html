    <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
    <p>My site will be one page with simple animation, scrolling top to bottom, and will consist of the following sections.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Welcome:</h2>
        <p>A welcome header of my name and have a line of my job title and who I am under the name header. Under the welcome section I would like to have a link/ button to my resume in a pdf.</p>
    <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>This section will go into more detail about my professional history, my skill set, my educational background, and any other professional accomplishments. This section will also display my strengths and the type of person I am. I also want to have a list of the programs and technologies I know how to use such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. This list will make it easier for the audience to read as they know my skills at first hand. After the list, I would like to add a one or two sentences of what I like to do outside of work/school.</p>
    <h2>Experience/Portfolio:</h2>
        <p>This section will have "jumbotron" style boxes, 2-4 of them, each of them will have a title and a description of each project. The right corner will have a link to gtihub and a link for deployment. At the bottom of each section, i will have light colored lettering with the programs used for the project.</p>
    <h2>Contact information:</h2>
    <p>In the top right corner, I would like to have an email tab, a github tab, and linkedin tab. The tabs will be visible as the audience scrolls through the page. If this doesn't look or work as well, I would like to have a separate section at the end of the page with my github, Linkedin, and email tab.</p>
