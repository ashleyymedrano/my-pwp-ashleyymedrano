<h1>PWP Milestone 2 Project: Ashley Medrano Porfolio</h1>
<div>
    <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
    <p>My site will be one page with simple animations of the texts and images. There will be also animations of the text appearing as you scroll up and down. The color of the portfolio will be dark blue with white and light blue text throughout the pages.  As you can see below, this is the overall vision for the portfolio and what it will look like from top to bottom. Then, I will go into each section and explain what my portfolio will contain.  </p>

    <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>This section will go into more detail about my professional history, my skill set, my educational background, and any other professional accomplishments. This section will also display my strengths and the type of person I am. I also want to have a list of the programs and technologies I know how to use such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. This list will make it easier for the audience to read as they know my skills at first hand. After the list, I would like to add a one or two sentences of what I like to do outside of work/school(more personal). As you can see on the mobile view, it wis the same as the picture for the "welcome" section. The "about me" and the welcome page will overlap a little since it is on the mobile view. For the website view, I would like the about me sections displayed on the left side and a professional personal picture on the right side.</p>

    <h2>Experience/Portfolio:</h2>
        <p>This section will have "jumbotron" style boxes, 2-4 of them, each of them will have a title and a description of each project. The right corner will have a link to GitHub and a link for deployment. At the bottom of each section, i will have light colored lettering with the programs used for the project. For the mobile view, my work experience will have around 3 tabs, and it will display each section of experience vertically It will also carry onto the next page as well. Whereas the website will have the tabs on the left side and display the experience sections on the right side.</p>

    <h2>Contact information:</h2>
    <p>In the top right corner of my page, I would like to have an email tab, a GitHub tab, and LinkedIn tab. The tabs will be visible as the audience scrolls through the page. If this doesn't look or work as well, I would like to have a separate section at the end of the page with my GitHub, LinkedIn, and email tab.</p>
